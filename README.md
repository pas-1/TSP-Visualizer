## About the Travelling-Salesman-Problem (TSP)

"A salesman is required to visit given cities only once, starting from any city and returning to the original place of departure. What route should be chosen in order to minimize the total distance traveled?"

## Functionality

I built this app due to my fascination for an algorithmic visualization of the TSP. The brute force algorithm visualizes optimal routes with up to 9 selected points.
